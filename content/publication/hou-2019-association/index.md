abstract: 'Objective: In order to explore the relationship between depression symptoms and cognition impairment in the elderly in China. Methods: The data is from the Rugao Longevity and Ageing Study (RuLAS), including 1526 older people. We collected the demographic data and used Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) to access the depression symptoms and Mini–Mental State Examination (MMSE) to evaluate the cognition in the participants. We used linear regression to analyze the relationship between GDS scores and MMSE score. Moreover, based on the grouping of education levels, we used logistic regression calculate the odds ratios for depression symptoms to cognition impairment. All the results were adjusted by adding demographic covariates. Results: In the crude model, we found that the GDS scores were significantly associated with MMSE scores (p<0.001, β= -0.67), indicating that those with worse depression symptoms also had bad cognitive function. This result was still significant after adjusting covariates. Moreover, we further analyzed the data according to the levels of education. In the crude model, depression symptoms in older adults in the illiterate and primary school groups significantly increase the risk of cognition impairment (illiterate group: OR=2.22, 95% CI,1.45-3.48, p<0.001; primary school group: OR=1.83, 95% CI, 1.08-3.07, p=0.024). The overall result was also significant ( OR=2.20，95%CI, 1.67-2.93, p<0.001). These results did not change after adjusting covariates. All the results above showed that the depression symptoms in the Chinese older people significantly increase the risk of having cognition impairment. Conclusion: Depression symptoms in the elderly significantly increase the risk of cognition impairment in the elderly, and clinical interventions in depression symptoms in the elderly may help prevent and slow down the symptoms of cognitive decline in the elderly.'
