### 1.Pelican vs. Hugo 

These are two static site generators. On GitHub, Pelican has _9.8k_ stars while Hugo has _46.1k_, indicating Hugo is much more popular (2020/08/20).Thus, I chose Hugo as my static site generator since it is much likely to have more technical support.



### 2.Install Hugo
After making the choice, I started to install the Hugo software on my windows 10 machine. I first downloaded **hugo_extended_0.74.3_Windows-64bit.zip** at [Hugo releases](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) and installed it according to the tutorials[2].



### 3.Create a working directory
Under the _Sites_ (according to [2]) folder,  I used Hugo to create a framework of the website by the code below:

```
$ hugo new site personal_website
```

After this, there was several files generated and these are the bases of the website.



### 4.Choose a theme.

After the previous step, I started to choose a theme for my personal page on [Hugo Themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/) website.  I chose the **Academic** theme, which provide many very sophisticated website templates and detailed tutorials[3]. I followed the [tutorial](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/install-locally/#install-with-git) and used the following commands to overwrite the files in the _personal_website_ folder. By doing this, I cloned the template [academic-kickstart](https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-kickstart) to my local PC:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-kickstart.git
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```



### 5.Edit the framework and customize it

This step took most of my time. The framework consists of several parts: home, publication, project and post. For the basic information of the website, I mainly edited files such as: *config/_default/params.toml* , *config/_default/config.toml*, *config/_default/menus.toml* , *content/authors/admin/_index.md* . These contribute to the biography part of the personal website. I did this mainly based on this [tutorial](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/get-started/) [4].  The content part (publication, project and post) is mainly based on this [tutorial](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/managing-content/) [5].



### 6.Deploy on site on GitHub

During the local website construction process, I already uploaded my code to GitHub several times. It is always a good habit to commit the code to the repository once you make some small changes.  

I first created two empty repositories on my GitHub account:

1) a repository called [personal_website](https://github.com/ZhuoranHou/personal_website) : store the Hugo code

2) a repository called [ZhuoranHou.github.io](https://github.com/ZhuoranHou/ZhuoranHou.github.io) : store the website code generated by Hugo.

Then, I committed and pushed my local code under _personal_website_ to the GitHub repository [personal_website](https://github.com/ZhuoranHou/personal_website). Afterwards, I changed the directory to the _Sites_ folder, and typed the following code:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:ZhuoranHou/ZhuoranHou.github.io.git
```

Then changed the directory to the folder _personal_website_ and typed this to deploy my website:

```
hugo -d ../ZhuoranHou.github.io
```

Afterwards, when I pushed the local _ZhuoranHou.github.io_ folder to the GitHub repository, the [personal website](https://zhuoranhou.github.io/) was successfully deployed.  

Every time I made changes locally under the folder _personal_website_, I had to use the _hugo -d_ command again to deploy the website and push it the GitHub repository.
